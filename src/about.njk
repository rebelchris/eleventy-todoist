        <h1 class="mb-8 text-4xl font-bold">Why I am The Todoist</h1>
        <p class="text-xl text-pink"><strong>Time for a change;</strong> It was in December 2017 I had a change in how I wanted to see life. I was just bored with getting home watching tv and not much more. Surely there must be more interesting stuff to do than this?</p>
        <hr class="w-2/12 my-12" />
        <p>Now the changes came one by one and this was calculated! Because it’s best to focus on one thing at the time and do that 100% instead of doing ten things 10%. I first wanted to feel good about myself so at the company’s Christmas party I got the whole company to join me in running a marathon (which we did!). So now I was doing one thing with a whole company which helps with motivation a lot! The running was getting a, so time for the next step, CrossFit! This was really something else. It was hard but very rewarding. After a month of CrossFit, I was truly addicted to it, you just couldn’t keep me from the gym. This meant it was time for a next change, eating healthy hence I was already running and doing CrossFit so I was already eating very clean but this meant going the extra mile. Besides sports I also made the agreement with myself to try more new things, there where a lot but to sum up some: Try new hobbies (BMX, drawing, coloring, motor), Be a volunteer, Visit new places. That’s just some of the stuff I changed, and it felt awesome!</p>
        <h3>A more drastic change</h3>
        <p>These changes happened over the course of 2018, halfway through in May I made a realization I needed more of a change in life to truly find what I’m about as a person. I went down to my inner self and asked myself where I wanted to be the most, Go back to Cape Town was the first thing that popped up. So I asked my boss if this was possible and well I’m writing this from a beautiful apartment in Cape Town.</p>
        <p>One of the first things I did when I landed here was getting a new Moleskine pocket-size book. I started writing down all the stuff that was spread over some of my todo lists. And I took this serious, there were days where I checked of 3 or 4 things of my list. It was only when people asked me if I was crazy, why are you doing so much stuff at once when I realized it was because I loved to do it. It gave me energy and this was what I wanted to do. This and talking to my Colleague Matt who asked me why I wasn’t blogging/vlogging these things gave me the idea for The Todoist. [You can read more about how I started this in my first blog.]</p>
        <h3>The Todoist is born</h3>
        <p>Becoming The Todoist was such a life goal, this means I’m talking my todo list to the next level of being serious about it. And I truly hope I can inspire someone to also start living their life in the now. Start doing things you really want to do! As for my list (view it here), it’s ongoing. It literally has no end to it. People keep giving me such cool options to do, I write them down and hope to get to them rather sooner than later.</p>
        <h3>Can I also be a Todoist?</h3>
        <p>Yes! I encourage everyone to become one, this is why I started the blog. I think everyone should pursue their goals and dreams in life. And you can follow me on this journey and learn from my steps and mistakes.</p>
        <p>Therefore I really love feedback, ideas, comments, pics. Please share them with me (keep in mind half of my list is recommended by friends) drop a comment or touch base on Facebook, Instagram or email me.</p>
